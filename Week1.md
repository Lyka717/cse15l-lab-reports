- Working directory when the command was run: **lecture1**\
The files system contains two directories, named _lecture1_ followed _messages_ (the messages directory is within the lecture1 directory), and within the messages directory, there are multiple text files. a _Hello.class_ file, _Hello.java_ file, and a _READ ME_ file.
When using the cd command with no argument, then in the terminal, your changed directory defaults to the top directory where it can only change to the next directory below it
