## `cd Commands`
__no arguments:__\

- Working directory when the command was run: **lecture1**\
The files system contains two directories, named _lecture1_ followed _messages_ (the messages directory is within the lecture1 directory), and within the messages directory, there are multiple text files,
a _Hello.class_ file, _Hello.java_ file, and a _READ ME_ file.
In the terminal, when using the cd command with no argument your changed directory defaults to the top directory (~), instead of a specific directory to input commands from, where it can only change to the next directory below it, which is the lecture1 directory
in this case.
